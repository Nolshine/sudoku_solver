SUDOKU SOLVER

copyrights reserverd to Ariel. M. Shaked ©2013




A work-in-progress, this algorithm is designed with the purpose of solving any and all standard sudoku puzzles.

FEATURES:
	* Can find out which digits can go in a cell, row, column 	  or box.
	* Can solve rudimentary puzzles composed of cells that
	  can only have one value in them; these are solved one
	  by one until the puzzle is full or can be solved no
	  more.

TODO:
	* Solve more complex puzzles
	* Interface for inputting puzzles (currently hardcoded
	  examples are used.)
